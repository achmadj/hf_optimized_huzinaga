# Hartree-Fock Roothaan Calculations Using Optimized Huzinaga Orbitals on Small Molecules

The repository includes techniques for optimizing Huzinaga Gaussian orbital functions and the corresponding code for conducting Hartree-Fock calculations. The objective is to attain the ground state energy of small diatomic molecules by employing an optimized STO-6G Huzinaga basis set that rivals or surpasses larger sets (e.g., 6-31G, cc-pVQZ). The Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out using the PySCF library.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, including the PySCF library, you can use the following command:
