# Hartree-Fock with Optimized Huzinaga Gaussian Orbital Functions

Hartree-Fock Roothaan Calculations Using Optimized Huzinaga Orbitals on Small Molecules

This repository contains methods to optimize the Huzinaga Gaussian orbital functions and the code used to perform Hartree-Fock calculations using the optimized Huzinaga Gaussian orbital functions. The goal is to achieve the ground state energy of H<sub>2</sub>, HeH<sup>+</sup>, HeHe<sup>2+</sup>, LiH, HF, and H<sub>2</sub>O. The PySCF library is utilized to perform the Hartree-Fock calculations.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, including the PySCF library, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install pyscf
```
## Publication
The code is developed to support and reproduce the results presented in the research paper titled "Hartree-Fock Roothaan Calculations Using Optimized Huzinaga Orbitals on Small Molecules".
